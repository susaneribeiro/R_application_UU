##Learning how to plot interaction plots in ggplot2
```{r}
library(readr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

dataset <- read_csv("Exam_Score_Prediction.csv")



#visually checking for interaction of study method and other variables (sleep quality, exam difficulty and facility rating)

interaction.plot(
  x.factor = dataset$study_method,
  trace.factor = dataset$sleep_quality,
  response = dataset$exam_score,
  fun = mean,
  type = "b",
  pch = 18,
  col = c("black", "grey30", "grey60"),
  xlab = "Study method", 
  ylab = "Mean exam score",
  trace.label = "Sleep quality"
)
